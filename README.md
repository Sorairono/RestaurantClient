## General Information
- A point-of-sale interface that can be used in restaurants.
- While many parts of the code are from the origin project [_Restaurant Management Software_](https://github.com/Sorairono/Restaurant), they are just code relating to UI.
- To connect to the server-side (back-end), Restful Web Services is utilized to get JSON data type from the database (more on this [_here_](https://github.com/Sorairono/RestaurantServer#general-information)).

## Technologies Used
- Java 8
- JavaFX - version 3.0.0
- JFoenix - version 8.0.10

## Features
Can be found [_here_](https://github.com/Sorairono/Restaurant#features).

## Screenshots
Can be found [_here_](https://github.com/Sorairono/Restaurant#screenshots).

## Project status
This project is no longer being worked on. When I felt like I had gained enough knowledge about JavaFX to work for the team, I slowly stop working on this project. However, there are still room for improvement and one day I might continue this project from where I left off.

## Room for improvement
Create more features relating to "Back office" (total spent, total benefit,...) and "Reservation".
